# FashionMNIST-Classifier

## Project Overview
The FashionMNIST-Classifier project aims to provide a robust solution for classifying fashion product images. Utilizing the Fashion MNIST dataset as a more complex alternative to the traditional MNIST handwritten digits, this project applies state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in categorizing various fashion items.

## Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset includes 70,000 grayscale images of fashion products from 10 distinct categories. With a consistent size of 28x28 pixels, the dataset is divided into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images, following the same split as the original MNIST dataset.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to train the model and test its performance on the dataset.

## Features
- Preprocessing scripts for image data.
- Examples of model training and evaluation.
- Illustration of results with confusion matrix and classification report.
